      intro: `
        In our search for the perfect setting for our wedding we've come across several places, each of which had their unique charm.
        However, we eventually chosen one of the oldest Palatia in Denmark; <a href="http://www.dragsholm-slot.dk/slotshotel/historie" target="_blank" class="name" rel="noopener">Dragsholm Slot</a>.
        We were won over by the castle's rustic atmosphere, the beautiful green and open surroundings in Odsherred, as well as the peaceful idyll far from the noises of the city.
        Furthermore, the castle has been of great significance to Andreas' family, as it has been a staple festive venue hosting his confirmation and the christening of his brothers, rich with family traditions such as the treasurehunt on the castle grounds organised by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/knud.skytte" target="_blank" class="name" rel="noopener">Morfar Knud</a>.
        It is with these reasons we invite you to join us for our wedding at Dragsholm Slot.
      `,
      ceremony: `
        The wedding ceremony will take place in the castle chapel, which with its capacity of only around 100 people will create the perfect romantic setting around the most important event of the day.
        The chapel is an integral part of the castle and is linked to the Knights Hall by 3 elegant living rooms setting the screne for the wedding party to follow.
        Fresh air can be enjoyed in the courtyard and a small bonfire will be lit after nightfall.
      `,
      stay: `
        The easiest way to the location is by car and a dive of about 1 hour 10 minutes from Copenhagen is to be expected.
        We made it possible to <a href="/stay" class="name">stay at the castle</a>, if you're interested in experiencing the full wine menu.
