      breakdown: `
        We recommend arriving half an hour early at the castle chapel to not keep Andreas waiting alone for his Mathilde.
        After the wedding ceremony a reception will take place in the idyllic castle garden were champagne and wedding cake will be served.
        Following that there will be a tour of the castle while the bride and groom are off having their picture taken on the castle grounds.

      intro: `
        In our search for the perfect setting for our wedding we've come across several places, each of which had their own unique charm.
        However, we eventually chosen one of the oldest Palatia in Denmark; <a href="http://www.dragsholm-slot.dk/slotshotel/historie" target="_blank" class="name" rel="noopener">Dragsholm Slot</a>.
        Here we were won over by the castle's rustic atmosphere, the beautiful green and open surroundings in Odsherred, as well as the peaceful serenity far from the noises of the city.
        Furthermore, the castle has been of great significance to Andreas' family. It has been a staple festive venue hosting his confirmation and the christening of his brothers, rich with family traditions such as the treasure hunt on the castle grounds organised by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/knud.skytte" target="_blank" class="name" rel="noopener">Morfar Knud</a>.
        With this in mind we felt that Dragsholm Slot was the ideal place for our wedding and we're very excited for you to join us.
      `,
      ceremony: `
        The wedding ceremony will take place in the castle chapel, which with its capacity of only around 100 people will create the perfect romantic setting around the most important event of the day.
        The chapel is an integral part of the castle and is linked to the Knights Hall by 3 elegant living rooms setting the scene for the wedding party to follow.
        Fresh air can be enjoyed in the courtyard and a small bonfire will be lit after nightfall.
      `,
      stay: `
        The easiest way to the location is by car and a dive of about 1 hour 10 minutes from Copenhagen is to be expected.
        We made it possible to <a href="/stay" class="name">stay at the castle</a>, if you're interested in experiencing the full wine menu.

      perks: `
        We have reserved every room the castle has to offer, so that those who wish to join us in dancing to the break of dawn, have a place to stay.
        Moreover they'll have the opportunity to accompany us to Sunday brunch the following day.
      `,
      checkin: `
        Check-in is at 15 pm, but we recommend, that you check in after the guided tour of the castle. Checkout is before 11 am the following day.
