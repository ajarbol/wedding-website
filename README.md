Andreas & Mathilde Wedding Website
=====================

[AMWW](https://andreas-mathilde.com) is built with the latest and greatest build of [Preact](https://preactjs.com/), and nothing more. In addition to showcasing our awesomeness, the site has been a quick excercise in creating a super fast, performant and progressive web product with a [Lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse) performance score of 100/100 -- enjoy.

## Running the sucker

#### 1. Run `yarn install`

This will install both run-time project dependencies and developer tools listed
in [package.json](./package.json) file.

#### 2. Run `yarn build && yarn start`

This command will build the app from the source files (`/src`) into the output
`/dist` folder. As soon as the build completes, it will start webpack dev server in development mode.

See the [configuration files](./config) for additional insights
